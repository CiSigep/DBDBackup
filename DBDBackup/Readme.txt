This application is intended for backing up Dead By Daylight saves.

WARNING: This application is not confirmed to not trigger an EasyAntiCheat ban. Use at your own risk.

Installation is as follows:
1. Compile the application and copy it and the BackupConfig.xml file to the Dead By Daylight game directory.
2. Rename the game executable to what you want.
3. Change the values in BackupConfig.xml to your preferred settings, make sure the game executable name matches what you changed it to
4. Rename the application file to DeadByDaylight.exe

This application will launch Dead By Daylight and while the game is running, create backups based on the config. It can be configured to save a backup only on game exit, periodically while the game is running, or watch the game save directory for changes and copy them.
